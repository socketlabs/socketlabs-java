The SocketLabs Email Delivery Java library allows you to easily send email messages via the [SocketLabs Injection API](https://www.socketlabs.com/docs/inject/).  The library makes it easy to build and send any type of message supported by the API, from a simple message to a single recipient all the way to a complex bulk message sent to a group of recipients with unique merge data per recipient.

# Prerequisites and Installation
## Prerequisites
* A supported Java version
   * Oracle JDK  8
* A SocketLabs account. If you don't have one yet, you can [sign up for a free account](https://signup.socketlabs.com/step-1?plan=free) to get started.

## Installation
Choose your installation method - Maven w/ Gradle (recommended), Maven or Jar file.

### via Maven w/ Gradle
Add the following to your build.gradle file in the root of your project.

```
...
dependencies {
  ...
  compile group: 'com.socketlabs', name: 'injectionApi', version: '1.4.0'
}

repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
...
```

### via Maven

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.socketlabs</groupId>
  <artifactId>injectionApi</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.4</version>
</dependency>
```

### via jar file

You can just drop the jar file in.

[injectionApi-1.4.4.jar](https://github.com/socketlabs/socketlabs-java/releases/download/1.4.4/injectionApi-1.4.4.jar)

[injectionApi-1.4.4-sources.jar](https://github.com/socketlabs/socketlabs-java/releases/download/1.4.4/injectionApi-1.4.4-sources.jar)

[injectionApi-1.4.4-javadoc.jar](https://github.com/socketlabs/socketlabs-java/releases/download/1.4.4/injectionApi-1.4.4-javadoc.jar)

Alternately, you can simply [clone this repository](https://github.com/socketlabs/socketlabs-java.git) directly to include the source code in your project.

# Getting Started
## Obtaining your API Key and SocketLabs ServerId number
In order to get started, you'll need to enable the Injection API feature in the [SocketLabs Control Panel](https://cp.socketlabs.com).
Once logged in, navigate to your SocketLabs server's dashboard (if you only have one server on your account you'll be taken here immediately after logging in).
Make note of your 4 or 5 digit ServerId number, as you'll need this along with
your API key in order to use the Injection API.

To enable the Injection API, click on the "For Developers" dropdown on the top-level navigation, then choose the "Configure HTTP Injection API" option.
Once here, you can enable the feature by choosing the "Enabled" option in the
dropdown. Enabling the feature will also generate your API key, which you'll
need (along with your ServerId) to start using the API. Be sure to click the
"Update" button to save your changes once you are finished.



## Basic Message
A basic message is an email message like you'd send from a personal email client such as Outlook.
A basic message can have many recipients, including multiple To addresses, CC addresses, and even BCC addresses.
You can also send a file attachment in a basic message.

```java
import com.socketLabs.injectionApi.*;
import com.socketLabs.injectionApi.message.*;

SocketLabsClient client = new SocketLabsClient(000001, "YOUR-API-KEY"); //Your SocketLabs ServerId and Injection API key

BasicMessage message = new BasicMessage();

message.setSubject("Sending A Test Message (Basic Send)");
message.setHtmlBody("<html><body><h1>Sending A Test Message</h1><p>This is the Html Body of my message.</p></body></html>");
message.setPlainTextBody("This is the Plain Text Body of my message.");

message.setFrom(new EmailAddress("from@example.com"));

//A basic message supports up to 50 recipients and supports several different ways to add recipients

// Adding To Recipients
message.getTo().add(new EmailAddress("recipient1@example.com"));
message.getTo().add(new EmailAddress("recipient2@example.com", "Recipient #2"));

// Adding CC Recipients
message.addCcEmailAddress(new EmailAddress("ccRecipients1@example.com",  "Recipient #3" ));

 // Adding Bcc Recipients
message.addBccEmailAddress("bccRecipients1@example.com");
message.addBccEmailAddress("bccRecipients2@example.com", "Recipient #2");

SendResponse response =  client.send(message);
```

## Bulk Message
A bulk message usually contains a single recipient per message
and is generally used to send the same content to many recipients,
optionally customizing the message via the use of MergeData.
For more information about using Merge data, please see the [Injection API documentation](https://www.socketlabs.com/api-reference/injection-api/#merging).
```java

import com.socketLabs.injectionApi.*;
import com.socketLabs.injectionApi.message.*;

SocketLabsClient client = new SocketLabsClient(000001, "YOUR-API-KEY"); //Your SocketLabs ServerId and Injection API key

BulkMessage message = new BulkMessage();

message.setSubject("Sending A Test Message (Bulk Send)");
message.setHtmlBody("<html><body><h1>Sending A Test Message</h1><p>This is the Html Body of my message.</p></body></html>");
message.setPlainTextBody("This is the Plain Text Body of my message.");

message.setFrom(new EmailAddress("from@example.com"));
message.setReplyTo(new EmailAddress("replyto@example.com"));

message.getTo().add(new BulkRecipient("recipient1@example.com"));
message.getTo().add(new BulkRecipient("recipient2@example.com", "Recipient #2"));
message.getTo().add(new BulkRecipient("recipient3@example.com"));
message.getTo().add(new BulkRecipient("recipient4@example.com", "Recipient #4"));

SendResponse response =  client.send(message);
```

## Managing API Keys
For ease of demonstration, many of our examples include the ServerId (SOCKETLABS_SERVER_ID) and API
key (SOCKETLABS_INJECTION_API_KEY) directly in our code sample. Generally it is not considered a good practice
to store sensitive information like this directly in your code. Depending on
your project type, we recommend either storing your credentials using Environment Variables. For more
information please see: [Using Environment Variables](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/env.html)

# Examples and Use Cases
In order to demonstrate the many possible use cases for the SDK, we've provided
an assortment of code examples. These examples demonstrate many different
features available to the Injection API and SDK, including using templates
created in the [SocketLabs Email Designer](https://www.socketlabs.com/blog/introducing-new-email-designer/), custom email headers, sending
attachments, sending content that is stored in an HTML file, advanced bulk
merging, and even pulling recipients from a datasource.
